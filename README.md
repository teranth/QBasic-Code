QBasic-Code
=======================================================

A repo to hold all of my old QBasic programs from when I started programming in highschool. Hopefully 
someone just starting out, or even some one with some experience finds the code interesting and/or useful 
in the future.

Most of this code is just simple programs I was building to learn at the time, and probably not very useful 
to anyone except those that like to learn by reading code or just enjoy playign with things. 

Best of luck to you all and have fun. This is the first batch of code, I have hundreds more to share and 
will try and update this as I have time, so others can learn from my practice coding.

=======================================================
Quick Description 
=======================================================
<b>3DParticles</b> - This is one my favorites, it will load a 3D object from a points file and then render it while spinning. You can use the morph functions to morph the points from one model into another as they load and it was an fun to build and play with. I hope others have fun with it as well.<br><br>
<b>D2Edit</b> - This was simple Diablo 2 Character Editor. It will most likely not work these days, but it allowed you to set your stash, change class, and reset level/talents etc. It should be useful for anyone that wants to learn more about editing binary data with QBasic.<br><br>
<b>KeenC</b> - A simple cheat editor built to make changes to Commander Keen save files. Again useful for learning to work with binary/hex data from QBasic.<br><br>
<b>EProgAI</b> - A very simple trigger based AI example, it can be taugth new things by typing LEARN, other wise it will respond to triggers it knows in a way that can fool some people into thinking it's smarter then it is.<br><br>
<b>ESnow</b> - A simple snow flake simulator written in QBasic and will allow the snow to stack up on items drawn on the screen, includes settings for wind and other enviromental aspects.<br><br>
<b>SPRITE_EDIT</b> - A Simple 2D picture editor, that will allow you to save the data out as raw points for use in QBasic.<br><br>
<b>QB3DEdit v6</b> - A basic 3D Model editor built in QBasic, will allow you to save/load/rotate/add points/remove points etc. Very basic but great for those trying to learn 3D coding in QBasic.<br><br>
<b>Times Test QB</b> - A simple Times Table Tester I built to help one of my sisters in Math.<br><br>
<b>LeetIT</b> - Will take any text you give it and make it into it's version of LEET, can Un-Leet text as well. <br><br>
<b>Cable</b> - A program designer to allow multi-player via a SERIAL cable in QBasic, great for anyone into Robotics as I also built this type of program to control robots via the computer.<br><br>
<b>AI Follow</b> - Extreamly simple AI to follow a moving player on the screen directly using SINE and COSINE.<br><br>
